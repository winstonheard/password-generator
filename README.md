# password-generator

* As a developer, I want to create an application that will generate random passwords for employees at a company

* It is done when a series of prompts is used to determine the password criteria

* It is done when the user is able to answer each prompt

* It is done when the following prompts are given (password length between 8 and 128 characters, use of uppercase letters, use of lowercase letters, use of numbers, use of special characters)

* It is done when the password length is met

* It is done when at least one character type is chosen

* It is done when, after meeting the criteria, a password is generated and printed to the page

## Mock
